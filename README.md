# Mercbex Voice Doctor™ 🌱🎙️

## Overview
Mercbex Voice Doctor™ is a **voice-first, multilingual AI crop advisory system** designed specifically for Indian farmers.

Farmers can simply **speak their crop name or problem** in their local language, and the system responds with **clear voice + text guidance**, including:
- Pest identification
- Disease diagnosis
- Nutrient deficiency detection
- Product recommendation (Mercbex ecosystem)

No typing. No app learning. Just speak.
